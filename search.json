    "content"  : "IntroHey there! My name is Jason, and for some reason you’ve stumbled onto my site.Whether it was to laugh at/with me on my rants, geeking out over playing games(currently Overwatch is my drug of choice), orbecause a technical guide sparked your interest, I hope you derive someenjoyment from this site.This is actually the 5th or 6th time I’ve tried to get a blog going. I keptbuilding and rebuilding prior versions on different platforms, and ended uplearning five or six different ways to deploy blog platforms instead of justwriting posts.Platform OverviewTechnically speaking, I am proud that I managed to get everything to this point,because:1.) I get to be lazy  There is no maintenance required for the site, just content updates. Since  hosting is taken care of by Github Pages, and  deployment taken care of by Cloudflare’s CDN,  all I have to do to update content is push to the github repo.  In this fashion the site also becomes distributed among the CDN’s  edge nodes, becoming fault-tolerant in the process (barring catastrophic  failure), all while minimizing latency globally.2.) I get free stuff until the heat death of the universe,or until they run out of business, whichever comes first  Free automatic optimization of static assets and TLS provided by Cloudflare  Free sending/receiving of emails from a custom email address via Mailgun *3.) This site has an extremely strong foundation  By fully leveraging Jekyll’s liquid templating,  this site can generate multiple output files from a single source  Has proper 404 error code handling  Has automatic redirects to the www. subdomain for better SEO  Automatically leverages Opengraph for all pages,  making any sharing on Facebook look good.  Automatically adds metadata to all blog posts and projects via Schema.org  markup  Is mobile-friendly* Up to 10k emails a month, which is overkill for my purposes.Existential Crisis QuestionIf you play Genji in Overwatch, are you supposed to spam“I NEED HEALING” when you get a kill, or emote over theenemy’s corpse?My AnswerI think I would uninstall the game and re-evaluate my lifefor picking trash heroes. At least it isn’t as bad asinstalocking Hanzo.Future StepsThere’s a couple projects that I’ll be adding to the site over time,along with the writing of technical articles and other blog posts.Blog Posts &amp;amp; Technical Articles  The first planned article will be on AWS and dev-ops in general  The second planned article will be on a specific clever trickto build in a programmatic circuit breaker into AWS  The third planned post will be something different, and be arant about NYC’s terrible housing market for renters  A fourth planned post fawning over theHamilton Musical, since I only justsaw it recently and was completely blown away and need to vent."
